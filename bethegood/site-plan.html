			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>At Be The Good we help provide gifts, supplies, and support to individuals and families who need a little extra help.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>At Be The Good, we believe that every person makes a difference.
                Whether you're looking for an in-person service opportunity, are able to make a donation to support your community,
                or want to give back in other ways, we have a project that will suit both your budget and time constraints.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>At this point, I plan to include JavaScript mostly for visual purposes.
                Hovering over objects to reveal information, a fake form submission for a signup of sorts,
                perhaps even reusing the credit card form from earlier in the semester to mock a donation.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

                At Be The Good we help provide gifts, supplies, and support to individuals and families who need a little extra help.
            </p>
            <p>
                On our site, you don't buy anything. Instead, you are signing up to buy something elsewhere for one of our beneficiaries. Once you purchase the item(s) to donate, you will personally deliver it (or have it delivered) to Be The Good, so we can in turn deliver it to the intended recipient. If you would prefer to donate cash and have us do the shopping, you can do that too!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for helping us spread hope, cheer, and love!

            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
                Be The Good was established in 2023. This charity has been operating under its former name, For the Love, since 2017. Be the Good will continue to support underprivileged students and families, as well as nursing home residents and other community members who are often unseen and unheard.
            </p>

                How You Can Help
            </p>
            <p>
                Donate: Please visit our Projects page to learn about our current efforts. You can also donate materials for those projects or give money directly via our linked PayPal or Venmo accounts. Thank you for your interest!
            </p>
            <p>
                Volunteer: We don't have a warehouse where volunteers are continuously needed, but there are often other opportunities for you to get involved. If you are interested in helping with special projects, like sorting donations after big events, delivering holiday banners to nursing homes, or wrapping Christmas presents, please reach out!
            </p>
            <p>
                Start Your Own Drive or Collection Project: Choose one of our projects and run with it! Involve your family, your neighbors, your co-workers, or your church community. Uniting for an important cause builds relationships and increases donations!
            </p>

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>
                Summer Banners: Each year, Be The Good supplies seasonal banners to nursing homes and assisted living residents in our community to provide a bit of cheer to those who need it most. Itâ€™s a simple act of kindness that goes a long way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create banners with a Summer theme. Banners (sometimes called bunting or garlands) should be 3-4 feet in length. Each flag on the banner should be 4x6" or smaller. Pinterest has great ideas. This is a wonderful activity for a youth group or women's event!
            </p>
            <p>
                Youth Helping Youth: To celebrate Global Youth Service Day, Be The Good will host a hands-on service event aimed at the youth of Colorado Springs. We will have service projects designed to benefit youth in the community and hope that most of our volunteers will be youth!
            </p>
            <p>
                Birthday Boxes: Donate party supplies to make a birthday party-in-a-box for a struggling member of our community. Boxes will be donated to food pantries around Colorado Springs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Birthday boxes are more than just fun treats. They restore dignity to those who feel forgotten, to those who are never celebrated. They are a gift to children, teens, and adults! Help us start the party!
            </p>
            <p>
                The items below are included in each box.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plastic container with lid (6 qt. size)
            </p>
            <ul id="birthday-box-list">
                <li>Cake mix</li>
                <li>Tub of frosting</li>
                <li>Happy Birthday banner/sign</li>
                <li>Package of balloons</li>
                <li>Festive paper plates (5" diameter)</li>
                <li>Festive napkins (5" size)</li>
                <li>Optional: Candles & sprinkles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please also include one 9x13" disposable cake pan per box. We can't count on the recipients having access to baking dishes. Thank you!
            </p>
            <p>
                Every dollar counts: Prefer to donate cash? Want to help but strapped for time? Please consider making a cash donation. No amount is too small, and every dollar will go directly toward serving members of our local community.
            </p>
