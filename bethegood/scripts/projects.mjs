                Donate party supplies to make a birthday party-in-a-box
                for a struggling member of our community. Boxes will be donated to
                food pantries around Colorado Springs.

                Birthday boxes are more than just fun treats. They restore dignity
                to those who feel forgotten, to those who are never celebrated.
                They are a gift to children, teens, and adults! Help us start the party!
                <br><br>
                The items below are included in each box.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plastic container with lid (6 qt. size)</li>
                <li>Cake mix</li>

                Each year, Be The Good supplies seasonal banners to
                nursing homes and assisted living residents in our community
                to provide a bit of cheer to those who need it most.
                It's a simple act of kindness that goes a long way.
                <br><br>
                Create banners with a Summer theme. Banners (sometimes
                called bunting or garlands) should be 3-4 feet in length.
                Each flag on the banner should be 4x6" or smaller.
                Pinterest has great ideas. This is a wonderful activity
                for a youth group or women's event!

                Please consider making a cash donation.
                No amount is too small, and every dollar will go
                directly toward serving members of our local community.
